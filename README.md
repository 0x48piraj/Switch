# Switch

Switch is a new take on the classic tile-based puzzle game.

Change which character you're controlling to reach your goal -- but be careful, as characters you're not controlling will often have a mind of their own! Progress through a multitude of tricky and challenging levels, and watch as that death count piles up.

Switch is written in Javascript using the HTML 5 canvas for rendering. It is playable in all major browsers, and is working in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 11. Enjoy!
